## Project Description
This section will be completed by analyzing flight data and integrating both airports and airlines with the first, extracting some visual plots that describe the problem of delayed and cancelled flights and discussing the major factors that affect flight lines, and taking any necessary action to address the problem. So, the next responses correspond to the visual plots, each with a summary, and in the end, there's a dashboard with a blend of the four plots. and the conclusion was
Four insight plots that were used to determine the primary reasons for flight cancellations in the United States, as well as the states with delayed arrival. By employing:
1-Bubble plot.
2- Map View.
3-Pie Chart.
4-Line Chart.
The dashboard for analyzing scheduled arrival time and average arrival delay, as well as flight cancellations of aircraft destination at each city with flightâ€™s number.
